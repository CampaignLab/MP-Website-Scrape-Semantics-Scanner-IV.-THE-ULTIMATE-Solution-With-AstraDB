AstraDB is built on top of the popular Apache Cassandra non-SQL database. DataStax provides AstraDB, as a multitenanted Database-As-A-Service (DaaS) offering in a multicloud environment. To signup for a free user account, follow the link: https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra 

The Python code script is formatted for use on UNIX/LINUX and MacOS platforms and can be executed thus: [user]$ chmod u+x ukmpprofile_astradb.py 

The challenge and task requires web scraping, natural language processing (NLP) for extracting key political statements using Regular Expressions, and storing the data in Astra DB as vectors for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the approach:

Scraping Data: Using requests and BeautifulSoup to extract MP information from the given URLs.
Extracting Key Phrases: Using Regular Expressions (re module) to find political statements and views.
Storing Results: Saving the extracted data as ukmpprofile.json.
Embedding & Vectorization: Using langflow, cassio, and sentence_transformers to store and retrieve data from Astra DB for RAG.

This script scrapes MP profile pages, extracts political statements using regex, saves the data as JSON, and embeds it in Astra DB using LangChain and Cassio.
